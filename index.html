    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
    <p>
        I was born in Lima Ohio
        and raised in<strong> Defiance Ohio</strong>. <br>
        I have lived in multiple states throuout my life including
        Ohio,Texas,North Carolina,and Kentucky.Three of those states
        were because of my step-dads military orders.
        I have lived in Ohio for the longest out of all of them
        this is the list of what I think is the list longest
        to shortest lived.

    <h3>My Family</h3>

    <p>
        My family and I are pretty close my mother has never
        been married to my biological father and I go to see
        him every other weekend also I am very close to my
        step-dad. My grandfather on my mothers side passed
        away five years agoand my grandfather on my dads side has
        stage three bone cancer currently. My grandma practically
        raised me for the first few years because of my
        mother's age.
